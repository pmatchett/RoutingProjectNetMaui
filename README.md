# RoutingProjectNetMaui

This is a simple project to generate a 2 dimensional Node based map. Then once the map is generated two points are chosen at random and the optimal path between these two points is determined using the A* routing algorithm.
The goal is to display this map and the path using a .net Maui application. The user will be allowed to alter settings such as the frequency of obstacles in the map and the size of the map.
This is a port of a similar project I had developped in C++ and I am using it to learn C#, .net and .net Maui

Currently a work in progress.
